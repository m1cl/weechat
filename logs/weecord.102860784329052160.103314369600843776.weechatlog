2017-09-10 14:58:39	whmountains	@rkhayat  Did you add the font-awesome stylesheet?
2017-09-10 15:00:33	rkhayat	I have react-fontawesome but I am not sure where to put the font awesome stylesheet. Should I import it from a top level css file?
2017-09-10 15:01:23	rkhayat	EDIT: I have react-fontawesome but I am not sure where to put the font awesome stylesheet (I don't see an entry index.html unless its in /public/). Should I import it from a top level css file?

2017-09-10 20:21:08	Irving Ventura	<@137979324132360193> hello there bro!
2017-09-10 20:21:25	Irving Ventura	do you remember when I was talking about the project structure a couple of days ago ?
2017-09-10 20:22:49	Irving Ventura	I was trying to do something like
2017-09-10 20:22:49		/pages
2017-09-10 20:22:49		    /SomePage
2017-09-10 20:22:49		        index.jsx
2017-09-10 20:22:49		        /components
2017-09-10 20:22:49		            /SomePageSpecificComponent
2017-09-10 20:22:49		                index.jsx
2017-09-10 20:23:17	Irving Ventura	having a components folder inside a page folde brakes up the build process
2017-09-10 22:46:31	Jacob_Bolda	@Irving Ventura must be trying to make it a page. Did you try prepending an underscore to the file name.
2017-09-10 22:47:36	Jacob_Bolda	It shouldn't try to make it a page then.
2017-09-10 23:27:33	Irving Ventura	ðŸ¤” nope, I didn't try that one, I can remember you said something about that, but I was somewhat sleepy at that moment
2017-09-11 12:38:30	mplis	i'm building a portfolio site for a friend, and i need to make use of some images in a few different ways. right now, i'm using a technique similar to how the image-processing example site does it, where it puts all images in a folder, uses `gatsby-source-filesystem` on that folder, and then queries for specific images with a regex on the `id`
2017-09-11 12:38:52	mplis	i was wondering if there was a better way. having to regex search on the `id` feels pretty hacky
