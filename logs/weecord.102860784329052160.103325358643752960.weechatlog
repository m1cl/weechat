2017-09-10 18:09:34	Slacker	well you cannot rely on just plain css in some ambitious projects
2017-09-10 18:10:26	Slacker	also css preprocessors are a must for developping custom themes for libraries/components
2017-09-10 18:10:59	Slacker	not to mention the loops, mixing , lighten,darken ,etc...
2017-09-10 18:11:06	Slacker	EDIT: not to mention the loops, mixings , lighten,darken ,etc...
2017-09-10 18:18:36	Paisley	that's why i said postcss with plugins
2017-09-10 22:52:24	CPT	Are AOC monitors any good?
2017-09-10 22:57:16	Ivan	I recommend just using LG or Samsung monitors. Although they're more expensive, their durability justifies the price.
2017-09-10 22:59:07	CPT	yeah LG is nice and Acer too
2017-09-10 22:59:19	CPT	Trying to find the holy graill: 4k, 144hz

2017-09-10 22:59:32	CPT	EDIT: Trying to find the holy graill: 4k, 144hz, g-sync

2017-09-10 23:00:03	CPT	EDIT: with ultrawide, g-sync

2017-09-10 23:45:09	Elijah	EDIT: https://twitter.com/tkh44/status/883836708453855232/photo/1
2017-09-10 23:49:24	Sonicrida	last I checked you can't get ultrawide over 100hz <@167763384350015488>
2017-09-10 23:49:30	Sonicrida	I think they are coming out soon though........
2017-09-10 23:50:35	Sonicrida	and definitely not above "2K"
2017-09-10 23:51:27	Sonicrida	since I don't think there is a better name for it ðŸ˜› because it's between 4k and 1440p
2017-09-10 23:57:22	CPT	@Sonicrida ðŸ˜¦
2017-09-10 23:58:58	Sonicrida	yeah I feel like the tech is still kinda unstable or something I guess
2017-09-10 23:59:11	Sonicrida	the chances of having to return some of the top tier ultrawides is still kinda high
2017-09-10 23:59:44	Sonicrida	that said, 2k 34inch ultrawide with freesync/gsync is still aweomse right now
2017-09-10 23:59:54	Sonicrida	but if you wanna wait until the higher res screens come out, that's fine too
2017-09-11 00:00:06	Sonicrida	Just make sure that you have a rig to power it depending on the stuff you play ðŸ˜›
2017-09-11 00:00:48	Ivan	@Elijah  I believe the font is Mono
2017-09-11 00:06:09	Elijah	hmm
2017-09-11 00:06:12	Elijah	can't seem to find it
2017-09-11 00:08:38	Ivan	are you using VS Code as your editor?
2017-09-11 00:17:31	CPT	@Sonicrida yeah my previous monitor was an Acer Predator x34
2017-09-11 00:17:38	CPT	Will probably get it again
2017-09-11 11:28:09	BearFriend	^ very british response to clowns.
