2017-09-10 18:38:57	theo23	Hello, I made a small commented demo of router v4 with  redux : https://codesandbox.io/s/BBpzO7P7n
2017-09-10 23:59:54	Zak	Hi guys, how do I create nested routing with react-router-v4? Currently I am using ```                <Route path="/classes/:id" render={({match}) => (
2017-09-10 23:59:54		                  <ClassDashboard id={match.params.id} />
2017-09-10 23:59:54		                )} />```  to generate routes from ids. I need to add another layer to the routing, so the urls would become `/classes/:id/[another id]`. How do I do this?

2017-09-11 00:08:26		```js
2017-09-11 00:08:26		// define the base path
2017-09-11 00:08:26		<Route path='/classes/:id' component={ClassDashboard} />
2017-09-11 00:08:26		// in the component rendered by the base path, match specific routes with a Switch
2017-09-11 00:08:26		const ClassDashboard = ({ match }) => (
2017-09-11 00:08:26		  <Switch>
2017-09-11 00:08:26		    <Route exact path={`${match.path}`} component={DashboardBase} />
2017-09-11 00:08:26		    <Route path={`${match.path}/:anotherID`} component={AnotherOne} />
2017-09-11 00:08:26		  </Switch>
2017-09-11 00:08:26		);

2017-09-11 00:19:17	Zak	Awesome, thanks
2017-09-11 11:38:04	maael	Are there any handy docs/upgrade guides going around for upgrading from react-router v2.x up to v4.x?
2017-09-11 11:42:04	Matis	just start from scratch, it'll be easier ðŸ˜„
2017-09-11 11:42:24	Matis	you can salvage your route configuration
2017-09-11 11:48:29	maael	ðŸ˜­ From scratch?
2017-09-11 11:48:43	maael	Better crack on with it then, cheers.
2017-09-11 11:53:21	Matis	it's different enough to where I'd consider it a different library with some vague similarities
2017-09-11 11:53:21		but they do have some article about migration:
