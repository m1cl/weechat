2017-09-10 19:24:22	BoomAlley	Can someone help with a Redux question in relation to react-navigation? I've got it wired up, and it works. But let's say I have a lot of components nested (Container > Sub-Container > Sub-Container > Component). On a button in that Component I want to jump to a new page. Short of passing in this.props.navigation to everything, how can I get to that object via Redux? What would my mapStateToProps look like?
